# Ping-Pong-Game
Developed a two-player real-time Ping Pong game using C, TCP sockets, and multithreading, enabling synchronized gameplay over a LAN with client-server architecture. Implemented continuous state exchange (paddle/ball positions, scores) at millisecond intervals to ensure smooth interactions and responsive controls.
